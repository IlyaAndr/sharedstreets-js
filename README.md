## A "digital commons" for the street

New digital tools have the potential to radically improve the efficiency, affordability, and
inclusiveness of our transport system, but success depends on cooperation between the
cities that build and manage our streets and the companies and transport services that use them.

As new transportation technologies emerge, cites need access to increasingly privatized
data about public infrastructure. While private sector innovators are collecting detailed,
street-level data in real time on everything from traffic speeds to transit use, cities don’t
have the access they need. Clearly a new partnership model is needed.

SharedStreets is building a “digital commons” for streets: a universal language for
communicating information about city streets, and a launching pad for public-private
collaboration and data exchange.

### Universal Data Standards

The platform allows parties to connect their own data workflows and systems and take advantage of a growing range of new data sources. SharedStreets data standards facilitate public and private collaboration through a non-proprietary
system for describig streets.

Shared digital infrastructure lets cities use standardized practices to ensure user and business privacy.
It also uses best-in-practice reusable licensing models to support public and commercial data sharing agreements.
